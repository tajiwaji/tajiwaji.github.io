    <p>Sables are small carnivores belonging to the weasel family, Mustelidae. They range from about 13 to 20 inches long, <br></br> 
        excluding their 5-7 inch tail, weighing 2-4 pounds. Their body color can vary from brown to almost black, sometimes <br></br> 
        with a throat patch from dusky to salmon.</p>
    <p>The sable has been categorized as a species of least concern by The International Union for Conservation of Nature, <br></br>
     with their being a population of over two million in Russia alone. They can also be found in northern Mongolia, China, <br></br> 
     and Japan. </p>
     <p>Sables play an important role in the health of their ecosystems by helping to control small rodents, squirrels, and  <br></br> 
        other animals. They also contribute to seed dispersal, eating nuts and berries when primary food sources are scarce.</p></div>
